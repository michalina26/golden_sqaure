## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

``` ruby
reading_time = calculate_reading_time(text)

# * text is a string with words in it
# * reading_time is an integer representing minutes
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

``` ruby
# 1
calculate_reading_time("")
# => 0

# 2
calculate_reading_time("one")
# => 1

# 3
calculate_reading_time(TWO_HUNDRED_WORDS)
# => 1

# 4
calculate_reading_time(THREE_HUNDRED_WRODS)
# => 2

# 5
calculate_reading_time(FOUR_HUNDRED_WRODS)
# => 2

```
_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._ 

## 4. Implement the Behaviour 

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
