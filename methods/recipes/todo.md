## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to check if a text includes the string @TODO.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

``` ruby
to_do_list()

# * 
# * 
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

``` ruby
# 1 

if string includes @TODO

# => true

# 2

if string does not include @TODO

# => false

# 3

if string empty

# => false

# 4

# => 2

# 5

# => 2

```
_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._ 

## 4. Implement the Behaviour 

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
